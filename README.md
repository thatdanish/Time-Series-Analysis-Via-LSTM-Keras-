1) In this notebook various visuals and plotings are shown.
2) Keras's LSTM layer (Bidirectional) Layer is used for this case.
3) Model Architecture is  as follows :
                               (1) 1 LSTM layer with units = 128
                               (2) 1 Dropout Layer with dropout of 0.25
                               (3) 1 final Dense layer
                               (4) optimizer = Adam (default values)
                               (5) loss = Mean Squared Error
