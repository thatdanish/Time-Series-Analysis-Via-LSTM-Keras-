In this notebook various visuals and plotings are shown.
Keras's LSTM layer (Bidirectional) Layer is used for this case.
Model Architecture is  as follows :
                                1 LSTM layer with units = 128
                                1 Dropout Layer with dropout of 0.25
                                1 final Dense layer
                                optimizer = Adam (default values)
                                loss = Mean Squared Error
